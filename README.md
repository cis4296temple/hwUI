Part 2: Using Bootstrap, create the UI for the Homework Project.

- Use Boostrap.

- Master and content pages are required and are good practice and will help in consistency and enable you to design quicker.

Remember – UI is not just putting all the fields down the middle of the screen. It involves thoughtful design.
